# AIRO Symposium Chatbot

## Overview
The **AIRO Symposium Chatbot** is an intelligent assistant designed for the AIRO Symposium. It provides information, answers questions, and interacts with participants through natural language processing (NLP) and hardware integration for real-world interactions. This chatbot is integrated with hardware components, enhancing the user experience with physical-world interactions such as lighting up signals, controlling IoT devices, and more.

## Features
- **Natural Language Processing**: The chatbot can understand and respond to queries in a conversational format.
- **Real-time Symposium Information**: Provides up-to-date details on sessions, speakers, and other symposium activities.
- **Hardware Integration**: Interacts with hardware components for visual or haptic feedback (e.g., LED lights, motors, speakers).
- **Custom Commands**: Execute specific hardware tasks such as turning on lights or moving a robotic arm based on user requests.

## Installation
